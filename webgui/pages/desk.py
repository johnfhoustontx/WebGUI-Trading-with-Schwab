"""The Desk (/desk) — one screen carrying the most decision-relevant element of
every other page, so the morning read is a single glance rather than a tour.

Tier-1 reader: it consumes ``cache:options:matrix``, ``cache:options:paper_account``,
``cache:options:driver_paper_account``, ``cache:options:flow_alerts``,
``cache:options:gex_status`` and ``cache:sentiment:regime`` and renders them. No
engine imports, no Schwab calls, no arithmetic of its own.

**The load-bearing principle: the Desk composes, it never restates.** Every
number here is produced by the same pure function its owning page uses —
``flow.alert_rows`` for the alert feed, ``paper``'s DTE helper for expiries,
``console_regime``'s label derivation for the regime word. This is not tidiness.
The app already carries a documented open bug where ``/sentiment/sectors`` and
``/sentiment/rotation`` print OPPOSITE regime verdicts, because each computed its
own headline from a different quantity on a different scale. A screen that
aggregates ten pages is ten chances to repeat that mistake, and a Desk that
contradicts the page it links to is worse than no Desk.

This module is pure display logic only — module-level functions over plain dicts.
The widgets and wiring land later, and none of it belongs here.

    NaN is False, so the running value survives), so an unguarded non-finite
    value does not degrade to "no reading" — it PINS a bound and renders as a

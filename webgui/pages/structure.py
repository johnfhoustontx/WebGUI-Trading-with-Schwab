"""The dealer-structure bar's geometry — where spot and the gamma flip sit
between the put wall and the call wall, as percentages along the bar.

Shared by the Desk (``/desk``) and the Symbol Dossier. It lived in
``pages/desk.py`` until a second page needed it; a page reaching into another
PAGE module for its arithmetic is the wrong shape, and this follows the
``pages/scorecard.py`` precedent (moved out of ``pages/driver.py`` on
2026-09-12 for the same reason). ``desk`` re-exports ``structure_positions``,
so ``desk.structure_positions`` still resolves for its existing tests.

PURE: no widgets, no bus reads, never raises.

    with the walls pinned to the ends, since the bar's whole job is to show where
    price sits BETWEEN them.

    Percentages, not a viewBox: the caller applies them as ``left-[{pct}%]``
    Tailwind arbitrary values. Drawing this as a scaled SVG would need
    ``vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`` to stop the non-uniform scale smearing
    the strokes, and DOMPurify strips that attribute — leaving strokes thick
    horizontally and hairline vertically while the server-side string stays
    perfectly correct, which is invisible to every test. Never raises.

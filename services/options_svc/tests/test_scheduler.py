"""Tests for the options service scheduler's GEX-collection cadence.

``gex_due`` mirrors ``autoscan_due`` but on the gex_collector cadence/window
(2-min slots within 08:30–15:20 CT on trading days) so intraday history is
written whenever this always-on service is up — replacing the fragile standalone
gex_collector.py window. Pure schedule logic, tested with fixed CT datetimes.

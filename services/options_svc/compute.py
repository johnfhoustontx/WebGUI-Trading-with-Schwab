"""Options compute module — NiceGUI-free engine-call layer.

Extracted from ``webgui/pages/options/scanner.py`` so the backend options
service owns the heavy scanner-engine call (the GUI tier will later consume the
cached result instead of running the scan itself). This module must NOT import
``nicegui`` or anything from ``webgui/`` — it depends only on the shared
``services._proxy`` accessor and the copied options-scanner engine.

The module-top ``sys.path`` glue + eager engine import mirror the page's. Now
that this runs inside the (process-isolated) options service, the ``scoring``
package-vs-module collision documented in the root CLAUDE.md can NOT occur: no
sentiment code is loaded in this process, so ``from scoring import ...`` (done
lazily inside ``run_full_scan``) resolves to options-scanner's ``scoring.py``
unambiguously. Therefore the page's ``options_scoring()`` collision guard is
intentionally NOT ported here — ``run_full_scan`` is called directly.
